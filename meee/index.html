     <h2>Graphic Design - Junior Year</h2>
     <p>I always have been interested in learning how Web works and the importance of learning about it. So I wish that in this semester I will have the opportunity to get new skills for my future career as a Graphic Designer.

     </p>
     <p>I love branding and challenging myself to learn new stuff. So I think that Web Design will be a new challenge for me.</p>
     <p>For my final project I want to create an webpage dedicated to my portfolio, degree project or a startup.</p>
